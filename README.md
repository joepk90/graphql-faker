# GraphQL Faker Refactor
A refactor of the [https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-faker](github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-faker) project. Libraries have been updated, and the code restructured - It's an improvement (IMO), but there is more that can be done.

The Front End (Editor) has been moved to a new repository, this now just handled the backend service that requests data from graphql and saves a customer SDL file.

The Front End Project can be found here:
