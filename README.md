# GraphQL Faker Server
A refactor of the [https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-faker](https://ggithub.com/graphql-kit/graphql-faker) project.

The main reason for making this project was to change the functionality of extending types. It is now possible to override existing fields on existing types, and return data you define. For more details of the complete project see:
[github.com/joepk90/graphql-faker-refactored](https://github.com/joepk90/graphql-faker-refactored)

---

This repository just handles the server side logic of the original GraphQL Faker project, allowing users to create a local custom GraphQL schema using `fakerJS` definitions, as well as the ability of overriding any existing remote schema by acting a GraphQL broker, intercepting requests and overriding the response to return fake data to the client.

The Front End (Editor) has been moved to a new repository, which can be found here:
[github.com/joepk90/graphql-faker-editor](https://github.com/joepk90/graphql-faker-editor)
